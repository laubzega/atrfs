# atrfs (2018/02/18)
pyfuse-based filesystem for Atari 8-bit ATR images

This is a first stab at a filesystem for mounting ATR files that hold images of
Atari 8-bit disks. So far only tested with SD and ED Atari DOS images.
Unoptimized to almost comedic degree, but rightly so, given the volume of data
it pushes around.

Read-only. Work in progress. Void where prohibited.


USAGE:

atrfs diskname.atr /mountpoint
